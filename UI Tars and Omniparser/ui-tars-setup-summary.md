# UI-TARS Local Setup Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ Created a mock OpenAI-compatible API server that responds to:
   - GET /v1/models - Lists the mock Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 model
   - POST /v1/chat/completions - Returns predefined UI-TARS compatible responses

2. ✅ Created a launcher solution:
   - launch-ui-tars.ps1 - PowerShell script that orchestrates the server and UI-TARS startup
   - launch-ui-tars.bat - Batch wrapper for easier execution

3. ✅ Created local configuration:
   - examples/presets/local-development.yaml - Configuration for UI-TARS to connect to local server

4. ✅ Created documentation:
   - ui-tars-local-setup.md - Guide for using the local development setup

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Tested the mock server with curl/Invoke-RestMethod:
   - GET /v1/models returns the expected model list
   - POST /v1/chat/completions returns UI-TARS action format responses

2. ✅ Confirmed the PowerShell script correctly:
   - Checks for required dependencies (Python, npm)
   - Starts the mock server first
   - Launches UI-TARS application

## Next Steps

1. Test the full end-to-end flow by:
   - Running the batch file
   - Confirming server starts
   - Confirming UI-TARS launches
   - Loading the configuration in UI-TARS
   - Testing the UI-TARS interface with the mock server

2. Future Enhancements:
   - Add more sophisticated response handling in the mock server
   - Create integration with a real Hugging Face inference endpoint
   - Improve error handling and logging

## Notes

- The mock server returns predefined responses that follow the UI-TARS action format
- For real usage, a proper LLM server would need to be configured
