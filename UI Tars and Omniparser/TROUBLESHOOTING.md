# OmniTool App Fixes - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Fixed

The main issue was that the "new task" functionality appeared broken - users would see animations but no actual task creation or feedback when things went wrong. 

### Key Improvements Made:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling throughout the application with clear user feedback
2. **Better Validation**: Improved input validation with specific error messages and guidance
3. **Progress Feedback**: Added status messages so users know what's happening during task processing
4. **Connectivity Testing**: Added a "Test Connectivity" button to help diagnose setup issues
5. **Infinite Loop Prevention**: Added loop counters to prevent tasks from running indefinitely
6. **Improved File Handling**: More robust file upload and management
7. **Better UI**: Clear input field after submission, Enter key support, better status messages

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following running:
- **OmniParser Server** (usually on localhost:8000)
- **Windows Host/VNC Server** (usually on localhost:5000) 
- **API Key** for your chosen provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### 2. Running the App
```bash
cd "UI Tars and Omniparser"
python omnitool/gradio/app_new.py --windows_host_url localhost:8006 --omniparser_server_url localhost:8000
```

### 3. Using the App
1. **Set your API Key**: Enter your API key in the Settings accordion
2. **Test Connectivity**: Click "ðŸ”§ Test Connectivity" to verify everything is working
3. **Choose a Model**: Select the appropriate model for your use case
4. **Enter a Task**: Type a task description like "Open a browser and search for weather"
5. **Submit**: Press Send or hit Enter

### 4. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

**"OmniParser Server is not responding"**
- Make sure the OmniParser server is running on the specified port
- Check if the URL is correct in the command line arguments

**"Windows Host is not responding"**  
- Ensure the VNC/Windows host server is running
- Verify the port is accessible

**"API Key is not set"**
- Enter a valid API key for your chosen provider in the settings
- Make sure the provider matches your model selection

**Task shows animations but nothing happens**
- Check the connectivity status using the Test Connectivity button
- Verify all servers are running and API key is valid
- Look at the console output for detailed error messages

#### Getting More Information:
- Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
- Look at the Python console output for detailed error messages
- Use the Test Connectivity feature to diagnose setup issues

## Example Tasks

Here are some example tasks you can try:

- "Take a screenshot and save it to the desktop"
- "Open notepad and write 'Hello World'"
- "Open a web browser and navigate to google.com"
- "Create a new folder called 'test' on the desktop"
- "Open the calculator application"

## Model Guide

- **omniparser + gpt-4o-orchestrated**: Best general-purpose model with planning capabilities
- **omniparser + gpt-4o**: Direct GPT-4o integration for simple tasks
- **claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022**: Anthropic's computer use model (requires Anthropic API)
- **omniparser + o1/o3-mini**: Advanced reasoning models for complex tasks

## Support

If you continue to have issues after trying these fixes:

1. Check that all dependencies from `requirements.txt` are installed
2. Verify your environment variables are set correctly
3. Test each component (OmniParser, Windows Host, API) independently
4. Review the console logs for specific error messages

The enhanced error handling should now provide much clearer guidance on what's wrong and how to fix it.
